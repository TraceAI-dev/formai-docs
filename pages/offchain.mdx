# Off-Chain Architecture

FormAIâ€™s off-chain infrastructure consists of a decentralized compute network of oracle nodes, initially connected to the Ethereum network, with the vision to become chain-agnostic, offering support and integration with all chains that support smart contracts. Recognizing the computational limitations faced by most global users, FormAI empowers nodes to collaborate in parallel if they cannot independently run a full AI model. This is achieved through a peer-finding algorithm integrated into the standard open-source core implementation, allowing nodes to daisy-chain with other nodes, thereby forming a collective of powerful computational units. This distributed and heterogeneous parallel computing framework is crucial as it ensures consistency and reliability across the network, enabling anyone with a modern laptop or computer to participate and contribute to the FormAI protocol.

These nodes perform inference tasks, manage standard blockchain interactions, scheduling, executing code, browsing, utilizing websites, operating tools, and connecting with common external resources.

## FormAI Node Software

The FormAI Node software is a crucial component that interfaces with the blockchain and the Form ChainKit. Compute requests from Form nodes are orchestrated based on proximity, trustworthiness, and an element of randomness to ensure equitable task distribution. The modular nature of FormAI nodes allows them to run any open-sourced Form agents, handling inference for AI tasks, providing environments for agents to use tools and interact with the web and real-world applications, and operating as chatbots for the Form network and its clients.

## Enhanced Security Measures

FormAI prioritizes security in off-chain interactions by implementing advanced encryption standards and secure multi-party computation (SMPC) to safeguard data privacy and integrity. This ensures that all communications and computations are protected from unauthorized access and tampering.

## Scalability and Load Balancing

The network employs dynamic scalability and load-balancing techniques to manage varying computational loads efficiently, ensuring consistent performance and reliability even under high demand.

## Node Incentives

FormAI has a robust incentive model for node operators, rewarding them for their contributions based on computational resources provided and the reliability of their operations. This ensures fair compensation and encourages sustained participation.

## Interoperability

FormAI is committed to achieving interoperability with other blockchain networks and external systems, broadening its usability and integration potential. This effort includes developing standardized protocols and APIs for seamless interaction with various platforms.

## Fault Tolerance and Redundancy

The network is designed with fault tolerance and redundancy strategies to ensure continuous operation and reliability. In the event of node failures, the system dynamically reallocates tasks to maintain seamless operation, ensuring that the network remains resilient and robust.
