# Overview

In the context of artificial intelligence and distributed systems, an "agent" is defined as a software entity that acts on behalf of a user or another program, with some degree of autonomy, to perform tasks, make decisions, and achieve goals. According to Michael Wooldridge and Nicholas R. Jennings, "An agent is a computer system that is situated in some environment and that is capable of autonomous action in this environment in order to meet its design objectives."

For FormAI, agents play a crucial role in facilitating decentralized transactions and in managing interactions between various components of the blockchain. These AI-driven entities operate within both on-chain and off-chain architectures, ensuring comprehensive, efficient and reliable execution of tasks. FormAI's agent architecture is designed to leverage the latest techniques in **decentralized computation**, **parallel processing**, and **machine learning** to provide a robust framework for handling complex and dynamic transaction processes.
