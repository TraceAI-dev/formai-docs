# Agent Lifecycle

## Initialization 

FormAI agents are instantiated in response to requests from user smart contracts. This process typically involves the following steps:

<Steps>

### Request Receipt

- A user smart contract initiates a request, via a Remote Procedure Call (RPC), to create an agent. 
- This request includes a schema containing key-value pairs that outline the context, conditions, and specific requirements of the transaction.

### Agent Creation

- Upon receiving the request, the Agent Coordinator contract assigns a suitable node for the task
- The created agent is provided with the input schema, ensuring that the agent has all the necessary information to perform its role effectively.

</Steps>

## Operation

Once initialized, the agent enters the operational phase, where it actively performs its designated tasks. The key activities during this phase include:

<Steps>

### Contextual Analysis

- The agent uses the provided schema to conduct a thorough analysis of the transaction details. 
- This involves validating the information, checking conditions, and interpreting the terms outlined in the smart contract.

### Intelligent Operation

- Leveraging advanced algorithms and AI models, the agent processes the transaction details. 
- It may run simulations, perform risk assessments, or cross-reference external data sources to gather additional insights. 
- At this stage, if the smart contract only requests AI oracle data, it would be transmitted, otherwise the agent moves forward in the workflow. 

### Decision-Making

- Based on its analysis, the agent makes a decision on whether the transaction should proceed. 
- This decision is informed by the predefined conditions and the agent's computational logic. 

### Explanation Generation

- In addition to the binary decision, the agent generates a natural language explanation that provides context and rationale for its decision.
- This explanation is designed to be clear and comprehensive, ensuring that all parties involved understand the basis for the agent's determination.

</Steps>

## Termination

The final stage of the agent lifecycle involves the termination of the agent's activities. This stage includes the following steps:

<Steps>

### Completion of Task

- The agent concludes its operations once it has outputted its decision and explanation. 
- The decision and accompanying explanation are then communicated back to the smart contract through secure and encrypted channels to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the information.

### Deactivation

- After completing its tasks, the agent deactivates.
- This process involves cleaning up any temporary data structures, closing connections to external resources, and ensuring that no residual processes remain active.

### Logging and Archival

- The agent's actions, decisions, and explanations are logged and archived for future reference and auditing purposes. 
- This ensures transparency and provides a record that can be reviewed if necessary.

### Resource Reallocation

- Any computational resources and nodes that were allocated to the agent are released and made available for other tasks. 
- This dynamic resource management ensures the efficient operation of the overall system.
