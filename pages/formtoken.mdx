# Form Token

Form Token ($FRM) is the utility token of the FormAI network. Form is used to reimburse node operators for their compute, and to incentivize the growth and development of the protocol. FormAI is designed to operate without the need for a central authority, allowing for decentralized decision-making and governance. Form token can also be used as a standalone cryptocurrency in lieu of other blockchains for secure transactions across the network.

## Summary

- **Research & Development:** Contributors to the development of the network will be incentivized via token distributions. 

- **Distribution:** Tokens are distributed to node operators based on the compute power contributed and the type of Form Node involved in the agent workflow.

- **Transaction Fees:** Node operators receive a portion of the transaction fees generated on the network.
