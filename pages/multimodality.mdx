# Multimodality & Capabilities

FormAI agents are designed to handle a diverse range of tasks and interactions, making them highly versatile with a powerful toolkit. This section explores the multimodal nature of these agents and their extensive capabilities, which enable them to effectively analyze transactions to provide valuable insights.



## Multimodality

The multimodality of the agents allow them to process content across various formats passed in the context of the schema, including:

**Text:** Agents can interpret and generate text using a Large Language Model, enabling them to understand transaction details, generate explanations, and communicate with users.

**Data Processing:** They can handle structured and unstructured data, including numerical data, spreadsheets, databases, and JSON objects. This ability allows them to perform complex data analysis and extract relevant insights for transactions.

**Visual Interpretation:** Agents can analyze and interpret visual data such as images and diagrams, which can be crucial for transactions involving physical assets or visual verification processes such as those with NFTs.

**Audio:** Agents can also process audio or voice inputs if required by the specific use cases.

## Agent Capabilities

To effectively examine potential transactions and support the dynamic needs of users before decision making, FormAI agents have been equipped with specific capabilities designed to enhance their operational efficiency, accuracy, and reliability. Some of the key capabilities include:


**Web Browsing and Information Retrieval:** Agents can surf the web, gather information from online sources, and cross-reference data to verify transaction details. This ability helps ensure that all relevant information is considered during the decision-making process.

**API Interactions:** They can call external APIs to fetch additional data, integrate with third-party services, and perform real-time checks. This extends their functionality and allows seamless integration with various platforms.

**Code Execution and Compilation:** Agents can run and compile code, enabling them to perform simulations, execute smart contract logic, and carry out complex computations. This capability is essential for validating transaction conditions and performing automated tasks.

**Task Automation:** Agents can automate repetitive tasks, such as data entry, monitoring transaction progress, and sending notifications. This increases efficiency and reduces the likelihood of human error.

**Tool Integration:** The agents have access to a comprehensive toolkit that includes various software and utilities. This allows them to perform specialized tasks such as document analysis in various formats, chat processing and sentiment analysis.
