# Decision Making

The decision-making process of FormAI agents is managed by a combination of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) Foundation model and a state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM). This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both models to ensure there is a reliable and explainable analysis for a potential transaction.

Reinforcement Learning involves training an agent to make decisions by rewarding it for desirable actions and penalizing it for undesirable ones. FormAIâ€™s RL Foundation model was developed in collaboration with the Vector Institute of Artificial Intelligence. It is powered by a universal encoder, allowing it to process a wide variety of inputs for contextual information from the smart contracts. This encoder transforms the diverse inputs into a unified representation, enabling the RL model to learn optimal decision-making strategies through continuous interaction with the transaction environment. The RL model's ability to adapt and improve over time ensures that decisions are made based on the most current and comprehensive data, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the outcomes.

A state-of-the-art LLM is employed and fine-tuned to handle the explainability and communication aspects of the decision-making process. The LLM also plays a crucial role in processing the initial contextual information that is passed to the RL model before a decision is made. By leveraging its advanced natural language processing capabilities with Tree of Thought reasoning, the LLM can interpret and synthesize complex transaction details, terms, and conditions, forming comprehensive context that guides the RL model's decision-making process.

Once the RL model reaches a decision, the LLM uses the contextual information passed to the RL model, along with the decision itself, to generate a natural language explanation. This ensures that the reasoning behind each decision is transparent and understandable to users, fulfilling the requirements of explainable AI (XAI). The LLM's advanced natural language processing capabilities allow it to articulate complex logical processes in a clear and concise manner, bridging the gap between sophisticated AI decision-making and user comprehension. In addition to providing explanations, the LLM enhances the overall functionality of FormAI agents in several other ways. It aids in drafting agreements, interpreting transaction conditions, and generating user-friendly reports.
