# Introducing FormAI
 
FormAI's fundamental mission is to unlock the full potential of blockchain through artificial intelligence. FormAI is a decentralized blockchain AI Agent oracle network, our guiding principle is to create the blockchain infrastructure for a post Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) world; supporting UBI, on-chain voting, humanity verification, and whatever else the future requires. The network is designed to prioritize **decentralization**, **modularity**, **speed** and **security**.

## Artificial Intelligence Agents + Arbiters
- **Secure transactions**
- **Verifying intents underlying agreements**
- **Enabling new forms of ownership**
- **Settling disputes**
- **Cross-chain interoperability**
- **Asset tokenization**
- **Collecting and transferring data**
- **Voting, governance and DAO functions**
- **Novel smart contract use-cases**

FormAI's AI Agents and Arbiters connect to smart contracts and act as third party intermediaries between parties to a transaction. The network enables users to securely and automatically ensure the intent underlying an agreement has been fulfilled before proceeding with a transaction. Before exchanging funds, the parties to a transaction set up the intentions of their agreement with the assistance of an agent or  optionally use an existing smart contract. The agent then generates context based on the input, and collects data requested by the smart contract. The agent uses both the context about the transaction and the data it collects to verify and execute the intentions of the parties. AI agents supervise/secure all transactions, and smart contract developers can set up agents to facilitate new forms of both public and private oriented transactions on the blockchain (service agreements, project fundraising, agent-operated DAOs, asset tokenization, decentralized insurance, inter alia).

The basic utility of the network is the security provided by the AI agents via the supervision of transactions. The agents are able to verify the authenticity and safety of a smart contract transaction before exchanging funds. Nodes can also securely receive and transmit data without revealing details via zero-knowledge proofs. Developers can contribute to and adjust the capabilities of the AI agents, as well as modularly utilize pre-existing capabilities based on their intended use case.

Aligned with the ethos of blockchain, FormAI is designed to be Open-Source and to continuously evolve to fit the needs of the community. AI Agent nodes can be updated to support State-of-the-Art models and adopt additional capabilities. Nodes are operated via a heterogenous interconnected Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) of GPUs and other AI hardware. Node operators are incentivized to provide compute via FormAI's native utility token.
